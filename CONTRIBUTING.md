Values: **Speed. Quality. Aesthetics.**

## Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code passes the linter (`npm run lint`).
4.  Issue that pull request!

## Standards

-   **Commits**: Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add new timer`, `fix: header overlap`).
-   **Styling**: Follow the existing Tailwind patterns. Avoid arbitrary CSS where utility classes suffice.
-   **Components**: Keep components small (`< 150 lines`) and focused.
