## ⚡ Philosophy

**MILES** is a next-generation gym tracker inspired by the kinetic energy of the Spider-Verse. It moves beyond simple logging to provide an immersive, dynamic interface that adapts to your training style—whether you're grinding out strength sets in "Miles Mode" (Red) or focusing on agility and flow in "Gwen Mode" (Pink/Cyan).

Built for speed, aesthetics, and progressive overload tracking.
